# HeartBeat-classification-using-ML


This software system will be a Web System for the average patient with an ECG recording that can be analyzed by the doctor. This system will perform the classification of ECG signals using machine learning techniques to provide substantial input to doctors to confirm the diagnosis. By using computational power to predict the existence of abnormalities, the doctor has an additional source of information which factors into the final diagnosis with greater accuracy than before.
More specifically, this system is designed to allow a doctor to accurately classify  ECG signals into arrhythmia types to detect heart diseases and helps in finding the best treatment therapy for patients. The software will take the ECG signals of a particular patient as input and compute the probability of abnormalities using the pre-trained model.
On the basis on comparison with historical ECG data, the model produces an output as a prediction.
